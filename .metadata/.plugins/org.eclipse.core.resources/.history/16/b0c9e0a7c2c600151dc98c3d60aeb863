/**
 * This application is for Java Bootcamp Lab 6 to translate English into Pig Latin
 * The application will
 * 	Prompt the user for a word
 * 	Translate the text to Pig Latin and display it on the console
 * 	Ask the user if he or she wants to translate another word
 * Build Specifications
 * 	Convert each word to lowercase before translating
 * 	If a word starts with a vowel just add "way" onto the ending
 * 	If a word starts with a consonant, move all of the consonants that appear before the first vowel to the end of the word, then add "ay" to the end of the word
 * Extended Exercises
 * 	Keep the case of the word, whether its upper case (WORD), title case (Word), or lower case (word)
 * 	Allow punctuation in the input string
 * 	Translate words with contractions
 * 	Don't translate words that have numbers or symbols. Ex: 189 and hello@grandcircus.co should be left as is
 * 	Check that the user has actually entered text before translating
 * 	Make the application take a line instead of a single word, and then find the Pig Latin for each word on the line
