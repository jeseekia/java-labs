 * This application is Lab 1 for January 2016 Java Bootcamp
 * The application has the following features:
 * 	Prompts the user to enter values of length and width of the classroom
 * 	Displays the area and perimeter of that classroom
 * 	Prompts the user to continue - keep measuring rooms
 * 	Only continues if the user agrees
 * 	Calculates the volume of the room
 * 	Ignores the case when asking whether the user wants to continue
 * 	Handles the exception if the user does not input a number for any room measurement
